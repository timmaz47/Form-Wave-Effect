I built this movie database app using an API available from: https://www.themoviedb.org/ 

The page displays by default the current most popular movies by showing any available poster for that movie, it's title and rating.
Hovering over a movie tile will display an Overview/summary for that movie.
You can go to the next page, go back to the previous page or any of the page numbers displayed at the bottom by clicking on the respective area.
The app also offers you to search the database and provides a result of all the closest matches to your search term.
