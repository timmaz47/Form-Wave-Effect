This project shows some interactive cards. 
In this case I used pictures from my own travels. The project helped me understand the importance of resizing and compressing images in order not to slow the website down.
Users expect to have a website load in under 3s and reducing your img/video sizes without compromising quality is key to this (not to mention the positize impact to ratings wrt SEO).
For real world applications these cards could be used for purposes such as showing; game information, testimonials, recipes etc.
