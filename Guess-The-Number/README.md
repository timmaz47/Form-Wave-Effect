This project is a small simple retro themed numbers guessing game and one of the first projects I built while learning Javascript.

The aim of the game is to guess the random number (between 1 and 50) automatically generated for each game in as few attempts as possible.

The number is randomly generated every time a new game is played (but remains the same throughout that game).
