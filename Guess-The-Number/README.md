This project is a small simple retro themed numbers guessing game and one of the first projects I built while learning Javascript.

The aim of the game is to guess the random number (between 1 and 50) automatically generated for each game in as few attempts as possible.

The number is randomly generated every time a new game is played (but remains the same throughout that game).

The game was originally built for desktop screens, but has since been updated to look (relatively) good also on mobiles.. I have an issue when using mobile phone and clicking the input to enter a guess number that the keyboard pushes my content upwards and squashes text making it non-visible. Any help solving this would be appreciated!
