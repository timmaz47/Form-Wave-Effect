One of my first projects and a common functionality of most websites nowadays. This is a simple site with 3 buttons, pressing any button will open a modal, clicking on the modal's 'X' or clicking on the background overlay or hitting escape key will close the modal. 

This helped me to learn how to apply a blur backgorund effect in CSS and how to loop through buttons of the same class in Javascript in order to identify the button which was clicked and display the correct modal.
