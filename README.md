# Form-Wave-Effect

In this project I want to add a 'wave' effect to the labels of a form. 
Once the user clicks the input field the label transitions upwards with a delay creating a nice wave effect and allowing the user to input their information.
If left blank the label goes back to original position.

Facing an issue only with Chrome where the label is not transitioning. Firefox and Microsoft Edge works as intended..
